==============================================================================
The aim of this exercise is to build an interactive game. The goal of the game
is to destroy asteroids with torpedos launched from a ship. The ship is
controled by the user.
This exercise is composed by 5 python file:

-asteroid.py: In this file, we defined the Asteroid class that contains
asteroids proprieties: position, velocity, size. There are also important
related functions, those give and set the proprieties and also return value like
radius or presence of intersection between an asteroid and an other object.

-ship.py: In this file, we defined the Ship class that contains
ship propriety: position, velocity, angle (heading) and number of lives
ship. There are also important related functions, those give and set the
proprieties and also return values like radius.

-torpedo.py: In this file, we defined the Torpedo class that contains
torpedos proprieties: position, velocity, angle (heading) and time of life.
There are also important related functions, those give and set the
proprieties and also return values like radius or presence of intersection
between a torpedo and an other object.

-asteroids_main.py: In this file, we defined the GameRunner, we defined here
the game process. It uses the other classes and we use different functions to

-screen.py: helper file from the open2cs staff that build several object in
the game.

Questions:

1) We chose to put arguments on Asteroid, Torpedo and Ship Class and not initialize
them in the init. Because we think that the class have to be neutral and
initialize the parameters on the GameRunner.

2) We chose to build functions manage_torpedo and manage_asteroids to do
all actions that torpedo and asteroids have to do.
And not several function for every actions. We find that more clear

3) We don't know if we have to display win or loss message if the user hit the last
asteroid and died. We think that is more logical to put loss message but we saw
the game solution and in this case that display 'win' then we chose that option.
