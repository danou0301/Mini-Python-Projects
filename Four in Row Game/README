==============================================================================

In this project, we developed a game named "Four in a Row"; on a screen board
there are two players who are playing with coins and try to align 4 of their
coins according to their mutual colors. The players can played from 2
different windows separately or one player can play against the computer
artificial intelligence that we have developed.


We used several Classes:
We import two Python library class.
Tkinter Class:
This class allows to us to display on the windows the game advance screen.
Socket Class:
It enables to communicate between several computer on same port and according
to the ip.


We developed Four files:
- game.py : This file contain the Game Class, is used to define the internal
logic of the game using several helpful functions.
- four_in_a_row.py : This file contain the GUI Class, it has been developed to
display on new window the schematic game advance.
- communicator.py : This files contain the Communicator Class that allow us to
send and receive message from other machine, that allow us to play with other
person.
- ai.py : This file contain the AI Class, we have developed a very basic AI.


We also used several pictures of coins, board and others images displayed on
the screen in order to show the game advance and for the comfortable user
gaming.
