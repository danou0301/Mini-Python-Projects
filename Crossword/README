==============================================================================
=  Description:   =
==============================================================================

It is composed by two program files who are able to check crosswords:
    crossword.py:
This program checks a list of word and verify how many time they appear in
a defined matrix in the directions fixed by the user and it returns the
answers in an other file by writing the word name and the number of appearance
in the matrix.
The user controls the program by the Linux interface. He commands the files
opening and writing by using the function.
There are 8 directions those can be selected by the user: u(upper), d(down),
r(right),l(left),w,x,y,z(different diagonal directions).

    crossword3d.py:
This program as the first one do the same thing but it is also check the
matrices in 3d, that means that it takes several matrices, sorts them one under
the second and will be able to "cut" them in the vertical (2 possibilities) or
in the horizontal direction and check all the 8 directions (as the first code)
in the new built matrices.
There are also 3 possibilities for the user for the "cut" choose:
a (horizontal), b and c (vertical directions)
