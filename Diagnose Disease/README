This project is about Node and decision's tree:

- In the First part we build functions that use a decision's tree and records
to find for example the illness that a patient have according to symptoms or
find all illnesses in the tree...
All functions: diagnose, calculate_error_rate, all_illnesses,
most_common_illness, paths_to_illness.
- In the Second part we build a optimal decision tree according to a record
file and symptoms to check.
Functions: build_tree, optimal_tree

There are  3 Classes:
- Node: This class represent a node in the tree, every node have a positive
and negative child corresponding of a Yes or No answer (if a person have or
don't have a certain symptom) or None of them, it's a leaf (illness).
- Record: This class represent a record, each record have illness and
symptoms
- Diagnoser: This class contain several functions that help to diagnose


Enjoy !
